# PoolTool 2.0.0 (beta)
### Things to note:
ONLY SWAPS ARE WORKING CURRENTLY

ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD ARE NOT PERSISTENT, YOU WILL NEED TO
ENTER THEM EACH TIME YOU LAUNCH THE APP (but not every transaction. thats a win).

---

Once downloaded, make sure to do:

```chmod +x PoolTool```
  
in the PoolTool directory and also

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

so you are up to date on requirements. If PoolTool was working on your machine,
it should run just fine after installing the new requirements. I am available if
you need any help.
