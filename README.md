### Things to note:
All features should be working. Please report any bugs.

ACCOUNT AND PASSWORD ARE NOT PERSISTENT, YOU WILL NEED TO
ENTER THEM EACH TIME YOU LAUNCH THE APP (but not every transaction. thats a win).

```git clone https://github.com/iamredbar/PoolTool --branch beta```

Once downloaded, make sure to do:

```
cd PoolTool/
chmod +x PoolTool
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- move to the PoolTool directory
- give the file PoolTool executable status (if it doesn't have it already)
- install the requirements

If PoolTool was working on your machine, it should run just fine
after installing the new requirements. I am available in the Telegram group if
you need any help: https://t.me/pooltool_community_edition

### Run PoolTool with:

```./PoolTool```
